And the last weekend of July, we held a panel about this expedition at the Star Wars Celebration in Germany, the biggest convention of its kind. But I had a special surprise in store for my colleagues. I bottled a special Save Lars whisky, six bottles of a Bruichladdich 20 Year Old 1992, one for each of the Saviours. Knowing that they would want to keep it, I got me a 7th bottle, to open and share the golden liquid so that they each at least knew what they had received. It is not a big or demanding Laddie, seeing that our demographic was the Lars crew, which are novices besides Imanuel and myself. It is just a great Laddie for a great project. And interest was so big that Imanuel and I are actually considering bottling some more from that cask. Obviously with a different label, as we want to keep this one exclusive for the Save Lars Crew.","The attack is very powerful and peppery, but then it immediately softens up thanks to the omnipresent vanilla.
